    <textblock>
      The VideoDining study is a Stage IB behavioral intervention development project. The&#xD;
      objectives are to determine the feasibility and acceptability of using video chat during&#xD;
      mealtimes (VideoDining) in community-dwelling older adults eating alone at home and to&#xD;
      evaluate changes in nutritional intake and loneliness in response to VideoDining.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The U.S. population is growing older and more adults are aging at home alone, by choice, or&#xD;
      due to a lack of affordable senior housing. Older adults who live alone have a less healthy&#xD;
      eating pattern, eat a smaller variety of foods and consume fewer fruits and vegetables than&#xD;
      those living with others. Additionally, eating alone, social isolation and loneliness often&#xD;
      accompany living alone and are independent risk factors for lower caloric intake, less&#xD;
      variety in the diet and malnutrition. Community-based interventions are needed to improve the&#xD;
      nutritional status of older adults living alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VideoDining uses video chat during mealtimes to virtually eat with another person and could&#xD;
      provide social interactions and modeling to improve dietary intake in older adults eating&#xD;
      alone. Extensive observational and experimental research shows that people eat more when&#xD;
      dining with others than dining alone, called the social facilitation of eating. Additionally,&#xD;
      a dining partner's modeling of eating can provide a guide for what and how much to eat. The&#xD;
      investigators have conducted a Stage IA proof-of-concept study of VideoDining in older adults&#xD;
      and will expand the development of this behavioral intervention with this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals are to determine the feasibility and acceptability of VideoDining and to evaluate&#xD;
      changes in nutritional intake and loneliness in response to multiple VideoDining sessions in&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults eating alone at home. In this single-arm intervention study,&#xD;
      thirty older adult Meals on Wheels participants will be scheduled to VideoDine with a dining&#xD;
      partner six times. Using a mixed-methods approach, the investigators will collect data on&#xD;
      older adults' ability to VideoDine, acceptance of VideoDining, dietary intake, and&#xD;
      loneliness. Data will be collected before starting VideoDining, after each VideoDining&#xD;
      session, and at the end of the study period. Development, adaptation and refinement of the&#xD;
      VideoDining intervention are additional key outcomes of this study.&#xD;

    <description>A research interviewer will use video chat to collect three 24-hour dietary recalls with each participant prior to starting the VideoDining sessions (pre-VideoDining). During the intervention phase, a research interviewer will use video chat to collect a 24-hour dietary recall after each VideoDining session to capture dietary intake during the VideoDining meal and subsequent day (post-VideoDining). Change in dietary intake will be calculated by comparing average caloric intake on the three pre-VideoDining recalls to the average caloric intake on the final three post-VideoDining recalls.</description>

    <description>A research interviewer will use video chat to collect three 24-hour dietary recalls with each participant prior to starting the VideoDining sessions (pre-VideoDining). During the intervention phase, a research interviewer will use video chat to collect a 24-hour dietary recall after each VideoDining session to capture dietary intake during the VideoDining meal and subsequent day (post-VideoDining). Change in diet quality will be determined by comparing average food group equivalents and the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) on the three pre-VideoDining recalls to the average for the final three post-VideoDining recalls.</description>

    <description>The Revised 20-item UCLA Loneliness Scale and the 6-item De Jong Giervald Loneliness Scale will be collected prior to VideoDining and at the end of the study after VideoDining. The Revised 20-item UCLA Loneliness scale measures an individual's subjective feelings of loneliness and social isolation. Each question is scored 1-4, for a total of 20 to 80 points, with 80 indicating more loneliness. The 6-item De Jong Giervald Loneliness Scale uses a 3-item loneliness scale and a 3-item emotional scale. Each item is scored 0, 1 or 2, for a possible total score of 0-6, 0 being least lonely and 6 being most lonely. Total sum scores for each scale will be calculated pre and post VideoDining and compared.</description>
